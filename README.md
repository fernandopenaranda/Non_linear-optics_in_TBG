For the sake of reproducibility, we show in this repo: the code, the data files, and the plotting functions used to generate the figures in our work: *Intrinsic and Extrinsic Photogalvanic Effects in Twisted Bilayer Graphene* [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 256603](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.256603)

Remarks:  

0. All the code provided here is written in Julia (v1.0 >)
1. Data files used to build each figure can be either directly accessed at `Non_linear-optics_in_TBG/data` or generated using the Non_linear-optics_in_TBG/src/Paper/paper_figures.ipynb file that also contains the plotting functions used in the main and supplementary sections

## Installation

In a Julia terminal: 
```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/fernandopenaranda/Non_linear-optics_in_TBG")
```
